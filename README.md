# Multiplayer-Tic-Tac-Toe-
A multiplayer tic tac toe (Nodes &amp; Crosses) game created using Astran Game Engine for my Data Comm &amp; Networking assignment. It is uses Bit Packer to condense the data send to other client, making its network data footprint down to a single unsigned char (datatype with least number of bit in C++) for each move.
